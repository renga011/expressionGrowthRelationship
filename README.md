# Code for analyses done in Renganaath & Albert (2023): Trans-eQTL hotspots shape complex traits by modulating cellular states

We divide our the analyses done in this paper into NUM areas. Each area has a separate code folder containing the scripts for performing those analyses. All analyses were performed in R versions 4.3.1 or 3.5.2. 

All but one script was written by Kaushik Renganaath. The script for comparing the results of the genetic correlations with that of the QTL effect correlations and the hotspot effect correlations (results for which are presented in Table S5 of the paper) was written by Frank. W. Albert with minor modifications by Kaushik Renganaath.

The scripts are all indexed in the order in which they ought to be run. Because the intermediate R objects generated in earlier scripts may sometimes be used again in subsequent scripts, mixing up the order of the scripts may throw errors in later scripts. We don't provide the intermediate R objects that are generated by our code in this repository. We just provide those that are not generated by our code in the directories titled "ROBJ" & "OTHERFILES", so that the user can use them to run our code. If anyone wants access to R objects or files to run specific scripts, they may request those from Kaushik Rengaaath via email (renga011@umn.edu).

Our code picks up or saves R objects to the directory titled. "ROBJ", saves the plots to "PLOT" and other files like the data tables from Albert et al. (2018) or Bloom et al. (2013) that were used by us, in the directory titled "OTHERFILES". In our code, these directories are contained in a directory that is denoted by the variable results_dir. You may adjust the value of this variable to the path of your results directory. Kindly ensure that the directories titled "ROBJ" and "OTHERFILES", which are provided by us in this repository are also saved to your results directory so that the code can properly access the required data files. 

For some of our analyses like our colocalization analyses, our code is so written so as to parallelly process multiple files using the SLURM high performance computing cluster provided by the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute, Univ of Minnesota, Twin Cities. The shell scripts used to run our code on the SLURM HPC cluster are also provided in the directories. These are not indexed like the R scripts in the directory as we provide them as mere templates to run our code on your respective HPC clusters.
